## Process

1. **Data Preparation:** Relevant datasets are stored in the `data` directory.
2. **Model Implementations:** Autoformer, GRNN, and Transformer models are implemented in their respective directories.
3. **Training and Testing:** Utilize Jupyter notebooks (`training_autoformer.ipynb`, `training_grnn.ipynb`, `training_transformer.ipynb`, `testing.ipynb`) for model training and testing.
4. **Utility Functions:** `utils` directory contains utility functions for data loading, training, and visualization.
5. **Analysis:** Jupyter notebook (`analysis.ipynb`) for further analysis and evaluation.

## Models

1. **Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs):** work by using gates to regulate the flow of information. They have two gates: the update gate, which decides how much past information to retain, and the reset gate, which determines how much past information to forget. This mechanism allows GRUs to maintain relevant information over long sequences and discard irrelevant data, making them effective for tasks like Human Pose Forecasting where understanding temporal dependencies is key.

2. **Transformers:** renowned for their effectiveness in handling sequential data, are particularly adept at capturing spatio-temporal correlations through Self-Attention mechanisms. This feature enables them to simultaneously process and relate different positions within a sequence, making them highly suitable for tasks like Human Pose Forecasting. By focusing on Spatio-Temporal (ST) Attention, transformers can intricately understand both spatial relationships and temporal dynamics, crucial for accurately predicting human movements in both space and time.

3. **Autoformer:** effectively utilizes correlations between distant time stamps to enhance its predictive accuracy in tasks like Human Pose Forecasting. By identifying and leveraging these correlations, the model can understand the intricate relationships and patterns that unfold over time. This approach is especially beneficial in scenarios where long-term dependencies and the interconnectedness of past and future movements are critical. The Autoformerâ€™s ability to tap into these correlations allows for more precise and reliable predictions of human poses, even across extended time sequences.
